<h1>Answers to Common Questions</h1>

<h2>What format should i send my track in?</h2>


<p>WAV or AIFF please.

Uncompressed stereo with a bit depth of at least 16bit, ideally 24bit and a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz up to 96kHz. No pre-processing using limiting or normalizing â€“ we need as much headroom as possible to work with to make sure that your tracks sound as good as possible when we mix or master it. </p>


<h2>How can I pay?</h2>


<p>You can pay with most major credit cards through a safe 3rd party 'Square' via the booking buttons available on various pages.

We offer alternative options via the 'book now' button at the bottom of the page.</p>


<h2>I want my track mixed or mastered. What are my options?</h2>


<p>We charge either in-person regularly priced studio time for mixing OR flat mixing and mastering rates based on the number of track stems.

We suggest going with the flat rate option because it allows our engineers to take their time over the course of several days to work on your project. We test the mix and master on several speakers and have the time to fully digest the song so we can optimize it to be its best.</p>

<h2>How will you deliver my track?</h2>


<p>Your track will be emailed or texted directly to you. We no longer offer CDs</p>
