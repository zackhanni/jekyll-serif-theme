<h1>Working Safely at Soma Sounds during COVID 19</h1>

<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>


<p>The Government Mandated Risk Assessment, produced in line with the specific government guide for offices and contact centres, follows the UK Government’s five steps to working safely. We recommend you familiarise yourself with this document ahead of coming to the Studios. Please note that this is an ever evolving document, as government guidelines, occupancy levels and operating experience influence our approach.</p>


<h2>What you need to know before coming to the studios</h2>


<p>To prepare for your visit check our guidelines for musicians and clients coming to the studios: Client & Visitor Guide. This document does not replace the need to read the detailed Risk Assessment and General Risk Assessment documents prior to arrival.</p>


<h2>Studio Capacity</h2>


<p>Studio live room and control room capacity will be significantly reduced to ensure that artists, musicians, engineers, producers and composers observe the current UK Government social distancing guidelines. Please read our Studio Capacity document for a guide to each studio’s capacity and control room occupancy restrictions.</p>
